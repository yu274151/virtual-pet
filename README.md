# Virual-Pet

A simple virtual pet game.

## Description

A pet with a happy state of mind (draggable) pops in the background. It wants to eat apples, candies, fun with toys and when in real fun mode, it can also rotate expressing its giddiness. However, hurry up because it will die if not fed on time and it will die.

## Game Scoring

* Each apple: adds 20 points to its overall health
* Each toy: adds 20 points to its fun-health
* Each loop: adds 20 points to fun health
* Each candy: deducts 10 points from its overall health

## Game Instructions

To begin, click "Touch to Start" or click anywhere in the background. It has two metrics of its well-being: happiness and fun. Clicking each treat from the bottom will block the UI (for itself and other treats), that is, until the pet drags itself to the position on the foreground where the treat is visible. It can enjoy a treat one at a time. The loop makes it to make two complete revolutions and gives a boost of 20 points to its fun health. However, candy is bad for it and reduces its overall health (can kill it). The clock is ticking so better feed it before the time expires and it dies.
